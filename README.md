# GreenHouse ðŸŒ±

Currently in *pre-alpha*, everything is subject to change and become (*hopefully*) better! 

## What is this?

This is an application for browser-based front-end QA testing. 
GreenHouse offers the abilitiy to **compile** Gherkin code into Playwright/Jest **test files** (`test.js`), which can then be run from anywhere using Playwright/Jest.

I am also building a docker image that is used for running these for local testing (in browser) and in a GitHub action (headless)

> Gherkin is a domain-specific language that enables the definition of business behavior without the need to go into the details of implementation. It's primarily used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), a software development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, non-technical participants, and business stakeholders. (Thanks ChatGPT) [more](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)

#### Example

`open_website.feature`
```gherkin
Feature: Open website and look at it

    Scenario:
        Given I open 'https://www.alexhawking.dev'
        Then I wait 5s

```
-> open_website.test.js
```javascript
// This file was compiled from Gherkin using GreenHouseðŸŒ± (https://github.com/Alex-Hawking/GreenHouse/tree/main)
// Source file: /Users/alexhawking/Desktop/Programming/GreenHouse/dist/bdd/features/test.feature

const Open = require('/steps/Open.js');
const Wait = require('/steps/Wait.js');
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
describe('Open website and look at it', () => {
  let browser, page;
  beforeAll(async () => {
    try {
      browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
      page = await browser.newPage();
      page.variables = new Map();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error setting up the browser:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  });
  afterAll(async () => {
    try {
      if (page) await page.close();
      if (browser) await browser.close();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error closing the browser:', error);
    }
  });
  const runStep = async (stepFunction, ...args) => {
    try {
      await stepFunction(...args);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error running step:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  };

	test("Given I open 'https://www.alexhawking.dev'", async () => { await runStep( Open.default.StepFunction, page, "https://www.alexhawking.dev" ) });
	test("Then I wait 5s", async () => { await runStep( Wait.default.StepFunction, page, 5 ) });
});
```
This file can then be ran using `npx jest` (given Jest and Playwright are installed), or from within the docker image.

## How does it work? (Docs)

There are 2 main parts to GreenHouse.

### Writing Tests

Tests are broken into 2 parts *features* and *steps*. <br>

**Features** <br>

Features are Gherkin script like below:
```
Feature: Example test

    Scenario:
        Given I say 'Hello World!'
```

Tests are saved as `.feature` files within the `/features/` directory of your `bdd` directory (more on this later).

Tests MUST have `Feature: (basic explainer of test)`  <br>

**Steps** <br>

Steps are the typescript code definitions for each action within the Gherkin script. See the below example:
```typescript
import Step from '@Steps/Template'
import { And } from '@Steps/Keywords'
import { Page } from 'playwright/test'

const sayHello = new Step(
    //Matching gherkin
    [
        Given('I say hello')
    ],
    
    //Handler function
    async (page: Page) => {
        console.log("Hello World!")
    }
)

export default sayHello
```
There are a number of default step definitions built into GreenHouse for common steps, currently the following are supported:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width:200px;">Name</th>
    <th style="width:300px;">Gherkin</th>
    <th style="width:200px;">Action Function</th>
    <th style="width:150px;">Usage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Open Url</td>
    <td><code>Given I open {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>Open(page: Page, url: string)</code></td>
    <td>Opens a url on the page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wait</td>
    <td><code>Then I wait {int}</code></td>
    <td><code>Wait(page: Page, time: string)</code></td>
    <td>Waits a set amount of seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Click</td>
    <td><code>Given/And I click {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>Click(page: Page, selector: string)</code></td>
    <td>Clicks an element on the page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equality</td>
    <td><code>Then {string} should equal {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Compares 2 items, generally variables</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Log</td>
    <td><code>Then I log {string} to the console</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Logs a string (or variable) to the console</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reload</td>
    <td><code>Then I reload the page</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Reloads the page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Save String</td>
    <td><code>Given I save {string} as {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Given/And I save {string} as {string}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Save Random String</td>
    <td><code>Given/And I save generate a random string with length {int} and save as {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Save a random string as a variable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wait For Selector State</td>
    <td><code>Then/And I wait for element {string} to be {string}</code></td>
    <td><code>N/A</code></td>
    <td>Waits for an element to be ['attached', 'detached', 'visible', 'hidden']</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The Step class constructor requires 2 arguments:
- *Sentences to match*, created using the pre-defined keywords
- *A handler function*, essentially saying what to do (all handler functions require the Playwright page object as an argument to allow the tests to interact with the browser page)

Currently the following matching keywords can be used:
```
Given()

Then()

When()

And()
```
Handler functions can also accept variables from the Gherkin sentence, see below:
```typescript
import Step from '@Steps/Template'
import { Given } from '@Steps/Keywords'
import { Page } from 'playwright/test'

const test = new Step(
    //Matching gherkin
    [
        Given('I open {string}')
    ],
    
    //Handler function
    async (url: string, page: Page) => {
        await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load' })
    }
)

export default test
```
The datatype to pass into the function is given between `{}`. Currently the following datatypes are accepted:
```
{string}: any characters between 2 quotes "" / ''    
{bool}: true / false  
{int}: any numbers (I will probably adding floating point numbers soon)         
```
Currently variables are passed in as arguments in the order they appear in the sentence. *Always leave page as the last argument*.

All typescript step definitions must be kept within the steps folder. See the below tree:
```
TestsFolder
â”œâ”€â”€ GreenHouse.js
â”œâ”€â”€ PickleDecs.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ bdd
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ steps
â”œâ”€â”€ pickle-dev
â”‚   â”œâ”€ (default steps, actions and templates are stored here)
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```
*Note:* The pickle-dev folder must be cloned in using the above structure, I will make a template to clone this in soon. The file `GreenHouse.js` contains config for the user to change. The files `PickleDecs.ts` and `tsconfig.json` are also in the test folder for compilation.<br>

**Variables** can also be used within your tests to save info between steps. Here is a simple example:
```
Given I save 'Hello World!' as 'testVar'
And I add log '$$testVar'
```
*Setting*<br/>
Within your step definitions variables are set using the Set action, like below:
```typescript
import Step from '@Steps/Template'
import { Given } from '@Steps/Keywords'
import { Page } from 'playwright/test'
import { Set } from '@Actions/VarControl'

const Save = new Step(
    //Matching gherkin
    [
        Given('I save {string} as {string}'),
    ],
    
    //Handler function
    async (content, varName, page: Page) => {
        Set(page, varName, content)
    }
)

export default Save
```
Setting a variable requires the `page` object, as well as the variable name (key) as a `string`, and the variable content (string, int or bool, dependant on what the function is expecting as provided in the *matching gherkin*)<br><br>
*Getting*<br>
Variables can be accessed from within features using `$$` and from within step definitions using the `Get` action, as below:<br>
*Usage within `.feature` files:*
```
And I add log '$$testVar'
```
*Usage within step definition `.ts` files:*
```typescript
import Step from '@Steps/Template'
import { Then } from '@Steps/Keywords'
import { Page } from 'playwright/test'
import { Get } from '@Actions/VarControl'

const LogVar = new Step(
    //Matching gherkin
    [
        Then('I log variable {string}')
    ],
    
    //Handler function
    async (varName: string, page: Page) => {
        console.log(Get(page, varName))
    }
)

export default LogVar
```

### Running Tests

*To run tests you currently must be within the greenhouse directory, also make sure you install all the modules*

First build all the typescript: `npm run build`
Then compile your Gherkin code into jest tests: `npm run compile <path-to-your-BDD-folder>`
Then run your tests: `npm run tests`

Optionally you can also run: `npm run reset <path-to-your-BDD-folder>` which basically just builds and compiles everything.

Also there a number of options that can be configured in `GreenHouse.js`, including things like headless mode and logging options.
