# GreenHouse ðŸŒ±

Currently in *pre-alpha*, everything is subject to change and become (*hopefully*) better! 

## What is this?

This is an application for browser-based front-end QA testing. 
GreenHouse offers the abilitiy to **compile** Gherkin code into Playwright/Jest **test files** (`test.js`), which can then be run from anywhere using Playwright/Jest.

I am also building a docker image that is used for running these for local testing (in browser) and in a GitHub action (headless)

> Gherkin is a domain-specific language that enables the definition of business behavior without the need to go into the details of implementation. It's primarily used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), a software development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, non-technical participants, and business stakeholders.
